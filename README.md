# Robot
Programmed a robot, that I built, using a micro controller and C in my Embedded Systems class.

This robot was hand built and required soldering, which is something I learned from this project. I have included all the files I used to make this robot function. Each file has configurations for the Tivaâ„¢ TM4C123GH6PM Microcontroller that is used to program the robot. 

GOAL:
The goal was to ultimately make the robot move forward and backwards by x centimeters and be able to turn clockwise and counterclockwise depending on the input given in the user shell I created which contains all the functions. I constructed equations based on the robots movement that could move almost exactly x centimeters and a practically perfect 90 degree angle.

This picture is of the robot early on in development, obviousily missing a ton of wiring and soldering to the mathcing pin outputs for the microcontroller.
